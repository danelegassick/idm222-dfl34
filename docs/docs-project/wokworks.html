                    WokWorks is a food truck serving Asian halal food, a niche among Philly food trucks. The owner, Kashif, is well-known among WokWork customers due to his friendliness. Additionally, customization is offered throughout the menu, which strengthens the appeal of WokWorks. In collaboration with other students, we took these features and brought them into an app for the truck.

                        WokWorks is known for their friendly and welcoming customer service. Many of their customers became regulars due to personal connections the owner and staff had made with them out of kindness.  <br><br>  Unfortunately, WokWorks is one of the many businesses that was affected by COVID-19, which caused them to have staff changes. Through this change, some personality of WokWorks was lost. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our main challenge was bringing the friendliness and fun back into the WokWorks ordering process to restore the welcoming experience that customers adore.

                        When preparing to begin the structure and design of our app, we knew we needed to construct a clearer picture of WokWorks as a company and a brand, as well as gain information about their customers. As a niche styled food truck with a goal of good customer service, WokWorks has a loyal clientele. The app was designed for both existing and new customers. The next step was to visit the physical location and dive deep into analyzing the business and consumer-sides of WokWorks. This stage of research included a SWOT analysis, the Four C’s, empathy mapping.

                        After completing this research, we moved onto Fly-On-The-Wall tests to better understand the users behavior and their interactions with the truck. Then, we conducted user interviews which gave us insight into target customers’ thoughts about WokWorks and what they would want out of a mobile ordering process. From this information, we created our user personas.

                    The high fidelity took all of these factors into account, causing us to adjust our design and prototype map. For this level, we also introduced additional steps to the usability testing. This was to continue and expand on our previous results in a more complex version of the app flow.
                    For next steps, we plan to turn this into a web app prototype!
