                    While digital design takes up a majority of my portfolio, I want to highlight my love for building
                    tangible products as well. Working entirely digitally can be exhausting, and leads to quick burnout.
                    To counter this, I began working on physical projects like rug-making and table-making during my
                    first co-op.

                        My interest in tufting, a.k.a. rug making, sprouted after seeing a surge in creative rugs online. I
                        noticed that people had bright and unique rugs on their floor, and I wanted to know how those were
                        made. After a deep dive into tufting, I learned that all I needed were a few tools to get started.
                        So, with my first co-op paycheck I got started.

                        The steps to start tufting are pretty straightforward. Get your cloth taut on the frame, project
                        your design (with a mirrored image), mark out where your colors will be, and start tufting.

                        Set up 2 lines of yarn to run through the tip of your tufting gun, set the speed to something
                        comfortable, and press the gun through the cloth. Then pull the trigger and navigate your gun
                        around to create outlines for each color. Then fill in your blocked out areas. The backside of
                        your cloth will have that classic rug texture.

                        Next step requires adhesive. The yarn has to be locked in and the bottom of the rug has to be
                        somewhat presentable. In this step, you apply a thick layer of adhesive to the back of your rug,
                        then seal that between another piece of fabric that will work as your underside. Then it has to
                        rest for at least a day.

                    Once this rug is all locked in, you want to cut it out of the frame. The edges of the tufting fabric
                    will be folded under the rug and glued down. You should have a great looking rug now, but I always
                    liked to refine my designs with shears and clippers. Shears ensure even distribution of yarn and
                    clean up any stray pieces. Then clippers can be used along the edges of each color to make clean
                    lines. Then give it a good vacuum and you are done!

                        research. I had a clear plan in mind from the beginning.

                        From Home Depot, I got a thin, circular piece of wood then projected the design onto it. I
                        traced the design then went to get some help cutting it out. This was a complex cut that I am
                        just not skilled enough to pull off, so I got some help from my grandpa. With this cut out, I
                        sanded the edges and started painting.

                        This had to be done in a 3 day sprint, so some of my family helped by taking turns painting in
                        the large yellow spaces. After two coats of paint were applied, I drilled in holes for a lazy
                        susan, and connected it to the wooden base and metal legs I got from Home Depot. This allowed
                        for it to be spun around giving it a little extra flair.
