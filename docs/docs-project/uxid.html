                    This was a collaborative group project with the goal of restructuring and redesigning the system as a whole. This project involved work amongst fellow students and faculty at Drexel. The designs were built in Figma, and the code built using React.

                    The Drexel Homework System redesign was a 2022 summer project, that a professor invited me to work on. It took place over the course of a few months. The backend was done by professors, but 3 other students and I were in charge of building out the designs and the React components.

                    The user of the homework system would have to log in, using their student ID, then select the class and assignment they would like to work on. Students would then attempt a problem and check if their answer was correct. If it was correct, they would continue down the page, and if it was incorrect they would get a hint and try again.
                    At the end of the assignment, the user would press submit and get a code to turn in elsewhere.

                    For this project, we wanted to ensure that elements could be used site-wide and be coded as React components easily. We also integrated a text editing software, Vercel, into our input fields with the help of a professor.

                        Once designs had been finalized, we got to work developing components in React. This involved a 3 file set up for each component: one for the CSS in JS, one for the React formatting of the HTML element, and then an index file to export it out of (to reference in other pages with ease).

                        Unfortunately, not all stories have happy endings. 2 weeks before launch, the project was scrapped because a professor would not cooperate or compromise on the designs. At the last minute, our work had to be scrapped and the designs never went live. However, the project was still extremely valuable in learning React, developing broader design systems, and balancing ideas on more professional products. Luckily, there is a stable link that shows our progress in what the final would have looked like.
