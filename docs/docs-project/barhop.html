                    This was a freelance project that a previous professor reached out to me for. This was my first freelance project. I was given general guidelines for what this project would include, but given no brand guidelines for this, so I could develop something from scratch.

                        Barhop is a developing business that is oriented at optimizing the night out for bar hoppers, providing data on local bars and promoting events for locals to attend. I was tasked with designing the homepage for an upcoming mobile app.

                        As the brand is associated with young people going out to barhop, I thought the colors should be fun: a beer-ish yellow as the primary color, with some green, blue, and purple accents to capture the essence of a party. The font was a simple sans-serif, as there wasn't much text on the screen, but the icons captured a bit more personality. Dark-mode was chosen, as this app would be used more frequently at night.

                        As the app has a lot of data to reveal to users, I had planned originally to give it a more tech dashboard look. However, after mocking up some designs and consulting with the client, this wouldn't work. The app needed to be friendly.

                            With a more friendly look in mind, some changes had to be made. My goals: more images, more icons, blockier uses of color. Seen below are the elements that needed to change.

                        To find a combination of images, icons, and colors that worked, I rapid fired some sketches out and gathered the best ideas in order to come up a friendlier interface.

                    For this project, I was also not told all of the features, so I could build out what I felt would be useful. Some of the ideas I prioritized were a favorites section, events section, map section, and featured section. The favorites section didn't make it into the final design (as per client request), but the others were well recieved.

                        I developed two different prototypes for this project to show alternative options for the client to pick. While these designs are not set in stone for the future of BarHop, aspects may be pulled through to the published app.

                    <p class="body-para light-text">
                        While this is all I was assigned to work on, I sketched out a few designs for other pages in case the client wants to come back for designs on the rest of the app. This was a great first freelance experience and got me in the practice of working with clients and aligning with their vision, rather than my own.
